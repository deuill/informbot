const (
	// The sender has sent a stanza containing XML that does not conform to
	// the appropriate schema or that cannot be processed (e.g., an IQ
	// stanza that includes an unrecognized value of the 'type' attribute
	// or an element that is qualified by a recognized namespace but that
	// violates the defined syntax for the element); the associated error
	// type SHOULD be "modify".
	BadRequest Condition = "bad-request"

	// Access cannot be granted because an existing resource exists with the
	// same name or address; the associated error type SHOULD be "cancel".
	Conflict Condition = "conflict"

	// The feature represented in the XML stanza is not implemented by the
	// intended recipient or an intermediate server and therefore the stanza
	// cannot be processed (e.g., the entity understands the namespace but
	// does not recognize the element name); the associated error type
	// SHOULD be "cancel" or "modify".
	FeatureNotImplemented Condition = "feature-not-implemented"

	// The requesting entity does not possess the necessary permissions to
	// perform an action that only certain authorized roles or individuals
	// are allowed to complete (i.e., it typically relates to authorization
	// rather than authentication); the associated error type SHOULD be
	// "auth".
	Forbidden Condition = "forbidden"

	// The recipient or server can no longer be contacted at this address,
	// typically on a permanent basis (as opposed to the <redirect/> error
	// condition, which is used for temporary addressing failures); the
	// associated error type SHOULD be "cancel" and the error stanza SHOULD
	// include a new address (if available) as the XML character data of the
	// <gone/> element (which MUST be a Uniform Resource Identifier [URI] or
	// Internationalized Resource Identifier [IRI] at which the entity can
	// be contacted, typically an XMPP IRI as specified in RFC 5122).
	Gone Condition = "gone"

	// The server has experienced a misconfiguration or other internal error
	// that prevents it from processing the stanza; the associated error
	// type SHOULD be "cancel".
	InternalServerError Condition = "internal-server-error"

	// The addressed JID or item requested cannot be found; the associated
	// error type SHOULD be "cancel".
	//
	// Security Warning: An application MUST NOT return this error if
	// doing so would provide information about the intended recipient's
	// network availability to an entity that is not authorized to know
	// such information (for a more detailed discussion of presence
	// authorization, refer to the discussion of presence subscriptions
	// in RFC 6121); instead it MUST return a ServiceUnavailable
	// stanza error.
	ItemNotFound Condition = "item-not-found"

	// The sending entity has provided (e.g., during resource binding) or
	// communicated (e.g., in the 'to' address of a stanza) an XMPP address
	// that violates the rules of the mellium.im/xmpp/jid package; the
	// associated error type SHOULD be "modify".
	//
	//  Implementation Note: Enforcement of the format for XMPP localparts
	//  is primarily the responsibility of the service at which the
	//  associated account or entity is located (e.g., the example.com
	//  service is responsible for returning <jid-malformed/> errors
	//  related to all JIDs of the form <localpart@example.com>), whereas
	//  enforcement of the format for XMPP domainparts is primarily the
	//  responsibility of the service that seeks to route a stanza to the
	//  service identified by that domainpart (e.g., the example.org
	//  service is responsible for returning <jid-malformed/> errors
	//  related to stanzas that users of that service have to tried send
	//  to JIDs of the form <localpart@example.com>).  However, any entity
	//  that detects a malformed JID MAY return this error.
	JIDMalformed Condition = "jid-malformed"

	// The recipient or server understands the request but cannot process it
	// because the request does not meet criteria defined by the recipient
	// or server (e.g., a request to subscribe to information that does not
	// simultaneously include configuration parameters needed by the
	// recipient); the associated error type SHOULD be "modify".
	NotAcceptable Condition = "not-acceptable"

	// The recipient or server does not allow any entity to perform the
	// action (e.g., sending to entities at a blacklisted domain); the
	// associated error type SHOULD be "cancel".
	NotAllowed Condition = "not-allowed"

	// The sender needs to provide credentials before being allowed to
	// perform the action, or has provided improper credentials (the name
	// "not-authorized", which was borrowed from the "401 Unauthorized"
	// error of HTTP, might lead the reader to think that this condition
	// relates to authorization, but instead it is typically used in
	// relation to authentication); the associated error type SHOULD be
	// "auth".
	NotAuthorized Condition = "not-authorized"

	// The entity has violated some local service policy (e.g., a message
	// contains words that are prohibited by the service) and the server MAY
	// choose to specify the policy in the <text/> element or in an
	// application-specific condition element; the associated error type
	// SHOULD be "modify" or "wait" depending on the policy being violated.
	PolicyViolation Condition = "policy-violation"

	// The intended recipient is temporarily unavailable, undergoing
	// maintenance, etc.; the associated error type SHOULD be "wait".

	// network availability to an entity that is not authorized to know
	// such information (for a more detailed discussion of presence
	// authorization, refer to the discussion of presence subscriptions

	// error.
	RecipientUnavailable Condition = "recipient-unavailable"

	// The recipient or server is redirecting requests for this information
	// to another entity, typically in a temporary fashion (as opposed to
	// the <gone/> error condition, which is used for permanent addressing
	// failures); the associated error type SHOULD be "modify" and the error
	// stanza SHOULD contain the alternate address in the XML character data
	// of the <redirect/> element (which MUST be a URI or IRI with which the
	// sender can communicate, typically an XMPP IRI as specified in
	// RFC 5122).
	//
	// Security Warning: An application receiving a stanza-level redirect
	// SHOULD warn a human user of the redirection attempt and request
	// approval before proceeding to communicate with the entity whose
	// address is contained in the XML character data of the <redirect/>
	// element, because that entity might have a different identity or
	// might enforce different security policies.  The end-to-end
	// authentication or signing of XMPP stanzas could help to mitigate
	// this risk, since it would enable the sender to determine if the
	// entity to which it has been redirected has the same identity as
	// the entity it originally attempted to contact.  An application MAY
	// have a policy of following redirects only if it has authenticated
	// the receiving entity.  In addition, an application SHOULD abort
	// the communication attempt after a certain number of successive
	// redirects (e.g., at least 2 but no more than 5).
	Redirect Condition = "redirect"

	// The requesting entity is not authorized to access the requested
	// service because prior registration is necessary (examples of prior
	// registration include members-only rooms in XMPP multi-user chat
	// [XEP-0045] and gateways to non-XMPP instant messaging services, which
	// traditionally required registration in order to use the gateway
	// [XEP-0100]); the associated error type SHOULD be "auth".
	RegistrationRequired Condition = "registration-required"

	// A remote server or service specified as part or all of the JID of the
	// intended recipient does not exist or cannot be resolved (e.g., there
	// is no _xmpp-server._tcp DNS SRV record, the A or AAAA fallback
	// resolution fails, or A/AAAA lookups succeed but there is no response
	// on the IANA-registered port 5269); the associated error type SHOULD
	// be "cancel".
	RemoteServerNotFound Condition = "remote-server-not-found"

	// A remote server or service specified as part or all of the JID of the
	// intended recipient (or needed to fulfill a request) was resolved but
	// communications could not be established within a reasonable amount of
	// time (e.g., an XML stream cannot be established at the resolved IP
	// address and port, or an XML stream can be established but stream
	// negotiation fails because of problems with TLS, SASL, Server
	// Dialback, etc.); the associated error type SHOULD be "wait" (unless
	// the error is of a more permanent nature, e.g., the remote server is
	// found but it cannot be authenticated or it violates security
	// policies).
	RemoteServerTimeout Condition = "remote-server-timeout"

	// The server or recipient is busy or lacks the system resources
	// necessary to service the request; the associated error type SHOULD be

	// service; the associated error type SHOULD be "cancel".
	//
	// Security Warning: An application MUST return a ServiceUnavailable

	// the intended recipient's network availability to an entity that is
	// not authorized to know such information (for a more detailed discussion
	// of presence authorization, refer to RFC 6121).
	ServiceUnavailable Condition = "service-unavailable"

	// The requesting entity is not authorized to access the requested
	// service because a prior subscription is necessary (examples of prior
	// subscription include authorization to receive presence information as
	// defined in RFC 6121 and opt-in data feeds for XMPP publish-subscribe
	// as defined in [XEP-0060]); the associated error type SHOULD be

	SubscriptionRequired Condition = "subscription-required"

	// The error condition is not one of those defined by the other

	UndefinedCondition Condition = "undefined-condition"
