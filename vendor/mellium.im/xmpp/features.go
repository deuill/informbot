	// this feature should only be advertised before the connection is
	// authenticated (eg. if the feature performs authentication itself), we might
	// set this to "Authn".
	Prohibited SessionState

	// Used to send the feature in a features list for server connections. The
	// start element will have a name that matches the features name and should be
	// used as the outermost tag in the stream (but also may be ignored). List
	// implementations that call e.EncodeToken directly need to call e.Flush when
	// finished to ensure that the XML is written to the underlying writer.

	// be flipped after negotiation of the feature is complete. For instance, if
	// this feature creates a security layer (such as TLS) and performs
	// authentication, mask would be set to Authn|Secure, but if it does not
	// authenticate the connection it would just return Secure. If negotiate
	// returns a new io.ReadWriter (probably wrapping the old session.Conn()) the
	// stream will be restarted automatically after Negotiate returns using the
	// new ReadWriter. If this is an initiated connection and the features List
	// call returned a value, that value is passed to the data parameter when
	// Negotiate is called. For instance, in the case of compression this data
	// parameter might be the list of supported algorithms as a slice of strings
	// (or in whatever format the feature implementation has decided upon).
