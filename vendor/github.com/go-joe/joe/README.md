Joe is a library used to write chat bots in [the Go programming language][go].
It is very much inspired by the awesome [Hubot][hubot] framework developed by the
folks at Github and brings its power to people who want to implement chat bots using Go.

## Getting Started

Joe is a software library that is packaged as [Go module][go-modules]. You can get it via:

```
go get github.com/go-joe/joe
```

### Example usage

**You can find all code examples, more explanation and complete recipes at https://joe-bot.net**

Each bot consists of a chat _Adapter_ (e.g. to integrate with Slack), a _Memory_
implementation to remember key-value data (e.g. using Redis) and a _Brain_ which
routes new messages or custom events (e.g. receiving an HTTP call) to the
corresponding registered _handler_ functions.

By default `joe.New(…)` uses the CLI adapter which makes the bot read messages
from stdin and respond on stdout. Additionally the bot will store key value
data in-memory which means it will forget anything you told it when it is restarted.
This default setup is useful for local development without any dependencies but
you will quickly want to add other _Modules_ to extend the bots capabilities.

The following example connects the Bot with a Slack workspace and stores
key-value data in Redis. To allow the message handlers to access the memory we
define them as functions on a custom `ExampleBot`type which embeds the `joe.Bot`.

[embedmd]:# (_examples/02_useful/main.go)
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/go-joe/joe"
	"github.com/go-joe/redis-memory"
	"github.com/go-joe/slack-adapter/v2"
)

type ExampleBot struct {
	*joe.Bot
}

func main() {
	b := &ExampleBot{
		Bot: joe.New("example",
			redis.Memory("localhost:6379"),
			slack.Adapter("xoxb-1452345…"),
		),
	}

	b.Respond("remember (.+) is (.+)", b.Remember)
	b.Respond("what is (.+)", b.WhatIs)

	err := b.Run()
	if err != nil {
		b.Logger.Fatal(err.Error())
	}
}

func (b *ExampleBot) Remember(msg joe.Message) error {
	key, value := msg.Matches[0], msg.Matches[1]
	msg.Respond("OK, I'll remember %s is %s", key, value)
	return b.Store.Set(key, value)
}

func (b *ExampleBot) WhatIs(msg joe.Message) error {
	key := msg.Matches[0]
	var value string
	ok, err := b.Store.Get(key, &value)
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to retrieve key %q from brain: %w", key, err)
	}

	if ok {
		msg.Respond("%s is %s", key, value)
	} else {
		msg.Respond("I do not remember %q", key)
	}

	return nil
}
```

## Available modules

Joe ships with no third-party modules such as Redis integration to avoid pulling
in more dependencies than you actually require. There are however already some
modules that you can use directly to extend the functionality of your bot without
writing too much code yourself.

If you have written a module and want to share it, please add it to this list and
open a pull request.
